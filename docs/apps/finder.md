# Intro
The Channel Finder application helps you quickly find more channels by simply putting in a YouTube video url.

# Walkthrough
The Channel Finder is designed to give you a simple interface that works hard behind the scenes to generate a list of channels semantically related

## Step 1: Input your API Key
The first step for successfully running the Channel Finder application is to input your DMT API key in the relevant field highlighted in this screenshot below:

Once you have inputted your key, the "Find Channels" button will be enabled and you can start successfully finding channels!

**Need an API key?**
If you need an API key, let us know! Get on the waitlist [here].


## Step 2: Input the intended video url

Once you have input your DMT API Key, the next step is to input a youtube video link that you wish to use to find related channels with.

The app will return an error if you submit any url other than a youtube video link, so please only submit youtube videos for now.

Want to find channels with other urls outside of YouTube video links? Let us know in this feedback form here!

You can change the video url and click the "Find Channels" button if the App is not currently processing any active requests to find channels based on a submitted video url.

## Step 3: Filter, export, or try again!

If the Channel Finder found channels, they will display in the table below the Channels Found header! 

Scrolling to the bottom of the table, you will find options to export as csv, to filter, or to reload the table data.

Each of these options is fairly explanatory - in this case, reloading the table effectively acts as a way to run the finder process one more time, and download as csv will take the entire table and download  it as a csv.
With the filter option, we have a useful tool similar to excel or google sheets where we can start to refine our data and filter for results that we care about:

:::note
Please note: when using the filter, you are only filtering on the dataset returned in the most recent Channel Finder run. Want to filter against a more complete dataset? Let us know [here](https://airtable.com/appzETVKT8y3nFxsx/shreeZck44tUeKVqf)!
