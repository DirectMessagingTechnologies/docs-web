# Welcome

DMT is _the_ solution for quickly getting started with influencer marketing by giving you a self service application with APIs to key creator datasets--and no conversations with a Sales person required!

If you've spent any time in the 'influencer marketing' or 'creator economy' space you will notice that most influencer marketing platforms provide an API as an afterthought or so severely marked up in price as to be non-viable to any developer or savvier growth marketer just starting to explore influencer marketing as a viable marketing channel.

With DMT, our mission is to make creator marketing a viable and productive activity for anyone, regardless of their stage in the market, and we've found that APIs are a great way to start opening up those insights to new and more people.

## What should I use the DMT API for?

Our goal is to give you a "workbench" for creator data and we have found several creative uses so far which include:

- Marketers use the `/estimate` endpoint to understand what to pay influencers for sponsored videos and posts
- Application developers use the APIs to embed creator data into their own (both advertising supported and paid) applications
- Researchers (_including marketers_) use the `/find` endpoint to automatically find lookalike and similar channels


## How to use this resource

Any new DMT API services that we provide will be documented in this section as an item in a given section and as a sub-page for a more detailed explanation of what and how that endpoint will return data to you.

## Anatomy of DMT Endpoints

The DMT Endpoints tend to conform to this pattern:

`baseUrl/:apiVersionNumber/:service/:group/:app`

The :string refers to a dynamic parameter that depends on the service and child group and app being requested. The Endpoints are organized this way with the goal of being intuitive of what kind of response and service they will provide in the response payload.

## P.S. So why is it called DMT?

Apart from its perspective-alerting qualities, DMT stands for "Direct Message Technologies" which we think nicely summarizes our mission of helping you get your message directly in front of your intended audience.
